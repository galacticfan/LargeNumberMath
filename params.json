If you know that the numbers that are going to be parsed into the function will be positive, then you can set this to true for performance purposes.</i></sub>\r\n\r\nFor the multipication method:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ string result = objName.Multiply(\"firstNum\", intNum);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor calculating factorials (input number must be larger than 0):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ string result = objName.Factorial(intNum);\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpon addition of more content, the README and this page will be updated.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Newbie's Guide\r\nAfter [importing](https://github.com/galacticfan/LargeNumberMath/wiki/Usage-and-Installation-of-the-DLL) your DLL and referencing the library, you are then ready to begin using the supplied methods.\r\n\r\nTo start, you will need to create an object of the class `LNMath` by doing the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ LNMath nameOfObject = new LNMath();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, using the object that you just created, you can access the methods within the library such as the `Add()` method.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ string result = nameOfObject.Add(\"firstNumber\", \"secondNumber\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n<i>Please note that the methods within the library are designed to take in numbers in the form of strings so that there is no limit in the size of calculation.</i>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
